## Hi 

I'm a social statistics analyst and PhD student, specialising in multilevel modelling methods for the social sciences. I do research into social, economic and health inequalities in the widest sense. 

I'm an expert user of Stata, and I know a bit of R and Python. I'm an amateur at Github. 

You can read more about my PhD research at www.kateohararesearch.uk .
