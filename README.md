## Hello and welcome,

I'm a social statistics analyst and PhD student, specialising in multilevel modelling methods for the social sciences. I do research into social, economic and health inequalities in the widest sense, with a strong interest in the statistical methods we use to detect them. I also work at the FORTH2O Datalab, where we are working on bringing together many social, environmental and administrative datasets to support policymaking in the Forth River basin. 

I'm an expert user of Stata, not bad at R and know a little Python. I'm finding my way with Github. 

You can read more about my PhD research at www.kateohararesearch.uk .
